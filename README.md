TermType

TermType is a Python-based terminal typing trainer built to help users improve their touch typing speed, accuracy, and consistency. It runs entirely in the terminal, providing a clean, distraction-free, and interactive environment that tracks your performance in real time.

The program measures key metrics such as Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, and key press latency, allowing you to monitor your progress after each session. Over time, it stores your previous results and highlights areas where you tend to make mistakes, helping you focus on your weak spots.

TermType aims to combine the feel of a lightweight terminal app with intelligent analytics. Future updates will include personalized practice sessions based on typing data and, eventually, AI-powered text generation tailored to different professions or programming languages.
